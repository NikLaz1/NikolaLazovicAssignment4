Assingment #4

1) Basic HTML layout was created and all necessary scripts were imported.
2) The JS for the project was divided up into three seperate JS documents, each with a specific purpose, so as to minimize code clutter and unnecessary confusion when being read.
3) The highscores page was created as a seperate HTML document.
4) We toggle back and forth between the two HTML docs based on where we are in the quiz. It is toggled by using the d-none feature.
5) Code was kept minimalistic and was described by commenting all the important sections of the code.
